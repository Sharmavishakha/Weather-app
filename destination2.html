    <h2 style="font-family:cursive; color:white ">Weather Forecasting is crucial since it helps to determine future climate changes. With the use of latitude,
        we can determine the probability of snow and hail reaching the surface. We are able to identify the thermal
        energy from the sun that is exposed to a region. Climatology is the scientific study of climates, which in simple
        words mean weather conditions over a period. A bunch of studies within atmospheric sciences also takes the
        help of the variables and averages of short-term and long-term weather conditions accumulated.</h2>
